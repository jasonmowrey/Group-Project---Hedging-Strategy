Our project aims to develop a Python-based tool that calculates the optimal hedging ratios for investment portfolios using derivatives, with the primary goal of providing investors with practical strategies to minimize downside risk.
Given the unpredictable nature of financial markets, effective risk management tools are crucial for investors. The project focuses on leveraging derivatives as a means to hedge against market downturns, addressing the need for an accessible tool that empowers investors to safeguard their portfolios through informed hedging strategies.
